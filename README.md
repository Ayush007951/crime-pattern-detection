# Crime Pattern Detection

## 📌 Project Overview
Crime Pattern Detection is a data analysis project focused on identifying meaningful patterns and trends in crime data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).  
The objective is to understand how crime varies across locations, time periods, and crime types, and to extract insights that can support data-driven decision making.

This project was developed as part of an **NTCC academic project** using Python and data visualization techniques.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
To analyze historical crime data and identify patterns related to crime frequency, affected areas, yearly trends, and property recovery.

---

## 🧠 Objectives
- Analyze year-wise crime trends  
- Identify high-crime areas  
- Study the relationship between property stolen and property recovered  
- Visualize crime distribution using graphs and charts  
- Extract actionable insights from crime data  

---

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed
- Area-wise crime analysis  
- Year-wise crime trend analysis  
- Property stolen vs property recovered comparison  
- Visualization of crime patterns using bar charts and line graphs  
- Identification of key crime insights  

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Certain areas consistently show higher crime occurrences  
- Crime rates vary significantly across different years  
- Property recovery does not always correlate with property stolen  
- Visual trends help identify crime-prone patterns effectively  

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Apply machine learning models to predict crime trends  
- Perform time-of-day and seasonal crime analysis  
- Build interactive dashboards using Power BI or Streamlit  
- Integrate additional datasets such as demographics or weather
